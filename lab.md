The University of Houston Brain-Machine Interface Systems Laboratory (UH BMIST) is led by Dr. Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal at the University of Houston Main Campus. The lab is dedicated to reverse engineering of human brain, and the design of non-invasive brain-machine interfaces and robotic systems for rehabilitation, enhancement or repair of the motor system after brain or body injury, neurological insults, or advanced aging. In addition, the team is also pioneering research and outreach by using museums and classrooms as laboratories to understand how the brain works in action and in context.
